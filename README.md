My thoughts on the exercise
===========================

I found the exercise to be simple.

I just wanted a quick way to get through the code using PHP and just be able to submit the requirements

I could have used Codeignite, but I thought for a quick project demo, it would be nice to see some custom-php l33t skills.


FAQ
===============

*What is this for?*
I'm submitting this for an test/exam. Others are free to fork and learn from it. It's just a simple registration form.


I followed the api about ajax submit on jquery.com
 -http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/

*How long did it take me?*

I started coding some customizations to the original script about 2:30PM. I finished now at 3:25PM. It took me an hour, it was due 2 hours ago.  

If I used Codeignite, it might take an extra hour to put the code in all the right places (i.e. using an MVC approach), I'll work on that if required.

*Why the theme Starfleet Academy*

I always wanted to be part of the StarTrek universe. I thought as a fan of StarTrek, something creative would be putting up some kind of registration for StarFleet.
